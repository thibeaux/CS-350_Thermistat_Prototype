# CS-350_Thermistat_Prototype

Q: Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
A: The project was to prototype a thermostate system that is connected to a heater. A user can increment or decrement a set point. This point represents the desired temperature. The system will then determine if the room temperature is higher or lower than the set point. If it is above the set point then we turn the heater off, which is indicated by the red LED turning off. If the temperature is below the set point we turn the heater on which is represented by the red LED turning on.
