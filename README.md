# CS-350_Thermistat_Prototype

Q: Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
A: The project was to prototype a thermostat system that is connected to a heater. A user can increment or decrement a set point. This point represents the desired temperature. The system will then determine if the room temperature is higher or lower than the set point. If it is above the set point then we turn the heater off, which is indicated by the red LED turning off. If the temperature is below the set point we turn the heater on which is represented by the red LED turning on. 

Q: What did you do particularly well?
A: I think I did well at planning the project ahead of time. Visualizing how all the components came together to make up the system. Then taking that vision and actualizing it into code.

Q: Where could you improve?
A: I think I can improve in my diagramming and documentation. My diagrams don't seem to completely capture the intended end result in my option. This is the main thing I'd like to improve on.

Q: What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
A: The schedulerwas a great tool to work with by ultizing a timer. 

Q:What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
A: The practice we had creating state machines and state machine diagrams where very helpful. The other thing I plan on ustilizing in the future it the use of timers to create as scheduler. 

Q: How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
A: I made this maintainable and readable by providing functions that can be utilized by the scheduler to perform taks. I also provided annotations and documentation for the code. This code is also adaptable because of the state machine. If we wanted to add a AC unit we could add an enumeration value to the state machine.
